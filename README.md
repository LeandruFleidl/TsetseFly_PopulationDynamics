I intend to add some code later to project the Tsetse fly population of the Kruger National park
however the majority of the work I have done is simply to better understand the work done by lord et al.

CountAndTemp.R reads in the temperature data and the tsetse fly count and combines them into
a useful database.

AdultMortalityAsFunctionOfTime.R reads in adult mortality data and plots it along with the predicted mortality as a function of temp.

LarvipostionAsFunctionOfTime.R Reads in larviposition data and plots it along with the predicted
larviposition as a function of temp.

PupalDurationAsAfunctionOfTime.R Reads in pupal duration data and and plots it along with the predicted pupal duration as a function of temp.
